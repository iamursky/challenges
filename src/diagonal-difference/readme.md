# Diagonal Difference

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-week-preparation-kit-diagonal-difference/problem

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix `arr` is shown below:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
```

The left-to-right diagonal is `1 + 5 + 9 = 15`. The right to left diagonal is `3 + 5 + 9 = 17`. Their absolute difference is `|15 - 17| = 2`.

## Parameters

- `int arr[n][m]`: an array of integers

## Returns

- `int`: the absolute diagonal difference

## Constraints

- $`-100 \le arr[i][j] \le 100`$
